# Human-Following-Robot


"HUMAN FOLLOWING CAR" in IoT is a fascinating endeavor that combines the 
realms of Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics to create 
an innovative solution for human mobility and convenience.
the project aims to develop a smart car capable of autonomously following a human 
operator, similar to how a loyal pet might follow its owner. This involves integrating 
IR sensors and ultrasonic sensors with AI algorithms for object detection, tracking, 
and path planning.
The project also encompasses aspects of safety, efficiency, and reliability, ensuring 
that the autonomous following system operates smoothly in diverse scenarios while 
adhering to strict safety standards

"HUMAN FOLLOWING CAR" in IoT fosters the development of a multifaceted 
skill set encompassing IoT development, embedded systems programming, sensor 
integration, machine learning, robotics, wireless communication, project 
management, and problem-solving. We learn to design, prototype, and implement 
complex systems by selecting and integrating hardware components, developing 
firmware and control algorithms, processing sensor data, and implementing 
machine learning models for object detection and path planning. Additionally, we
gain proficiency in wireless communication protocols for enabling interaction 
between the human operator and the autonomous vehicle. Throughout the project, 
we also hone our project management skills by planning, organizing, and 
executing tasks within constraints of time and resources, while developing 
problem-solving abilities to overcome technical challenges and ensure the 
successful implementation of the project.
